## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher  
- (If using) MySQL server (or other DB)  
- (Optional) IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans  

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayshegulkoca/foodordering.git
   cd foodordering


2. Import the project into your IDE (or open as existing project).

## Database Setup

1. Create a database (e.g. foodordering_db).

2. Run the provided SQL script (if any) to create tables and seed initial data.
   > If there is a file like schema.sql or data.sql, use that.

3. Update database connection settings in your project (usually in a config file or class), e.g.:
   ``` bash
   String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/foodordering_db";
   String username = "your_db_user";
   String password = "your_db_password";

 ## Running the Application

Run the main class (for example Main.java) from your IDE.

Or build a runnable .jar and execute:

   ``` bash
   java -jar foodordering.jar 
   ```
## Usage

1. Register a new user or login with existing credentials.
2. Browse the menu and select food items.
3. Add items to cart, adjust quantity if needed.
4. Confirm order — this generates the invoice/receipt.
5. If admin, access admin panel to manage menu items, orders, users, etc.
